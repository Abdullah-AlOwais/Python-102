# Python-102

This project is for one of the "Full Stack Python" Courses 
which consists of several courses and each course contains a simple project,
provided by SATR Platform.

A simple Birth Date Calculator program that enables you to calculate age and some other functions.

# Requirements:

Build a program that receives an unlimited number of people's names and birthdates.
The program calculates the age, so that it receives the date, and returns to us the current age, Also the name of the day she/he was born.
The program also prints the age of the oldest and youngest person, and the total number of people.And if only one person is entered,
the oldest and youngest person is not calculated, and the following phrase will appear to the user: *"There is no oldest or youngest person"*
The date value, year value, month and day value must be validو and if the date is Invalid, the following statement will appear to the user “Invalid date” and the name of the person with the wrong date

# Course learning outcomes:
